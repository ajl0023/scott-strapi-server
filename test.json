The teachers at this school are incredibly invested in the well-being and education of every child that enters their doors. There has been a move to more social-emotional learning as well as mindfulness which has definitely been helpful with the current remote schooling situation. The booster club is excellent at fundraising, giving our children access to computer lab, visual art, dance, music, extra teaching aides, PE, chess, math enrichment and even African dance! All the things every school should have but can't due to lack of state funding. It is also an exceptionally diverse school, with families not just LA but from around the world. While our teachers have handled the jump to remote learning quite well considering, we are definitely looking forward to the day when we can send our daughter back in person, she misses school so much!",

              "review": "Rosewood is a true gem of a school. The principal and teachers strive for both academic excellence and strong socio-emotional development for all students, from high achievers to those needing extra help. The school just became a stem magnet focusing on urban planning and urban design, and the teachers all worked very hard to deign--and are very excited to implement--the new stem magnet curriculum. The teachers, as well as the principal, Mrs. Crowder, are committed to professional development and to implementing the latest techniques (for example, Mrs. Crowder just secured a grant for wobble desks/seats for students who have trouble sitting still for too long, and will also be implementing yoga/meditation for the kids). The teachers are all caring, energetic, motivated, and devoted to the students. Principal Crowder not only knows the name of every student in her school, but knows how they're doing in school, what's going on with them at home, and what they need from the school. The kids are exceedingly nice--several students came to Rosewood to get away from bullying at their prior schools, and have not experienced anything like that at Rosewood. The school is very diverse, including socio-economically (which makes its test scores very impressive, since generally, the richer the families at the school, the higher the test scores). There is an impressive array of extra-curriculars at the school: a steller music program provided by the non-profit Adopt the Arts (including an honors choir), a garden program taught by a master gardener, dance/theater/visual arts, a science lab, a computer center, a full library with an amazing librarian, after-school musicals (for a fee), and free after-school programs until 6pm. This is our fifth year at the school, and we've been extremely happy. My son loves his teachers, has great friends, enjoys going to school, is learning a lot and doing very well.",

Leadership group is no longer help for college application. Finally my child graduates soon.

Every LAUSD school has the same issues with limited services, bad food, and a typical 36:1 student-teacher ratio. The majority of the kids are bused in, but I feel we get the cream of the crop. The school has a rich history of servicing kids who want to be here. Many of the students care about graduation and do well overall. As mentioned earlier I came from schools where students came in with an impoverish mindset. I don't feel that to be the case here. The campus is very diverse and representative of the real world. My child has been sheltered attending a certified Montessori school where she is not tested as much as LAUSD schools. Eventually, she will need to experience the \"general population\" and I believe Fairfax High School would be a nice transition.",

There are more new staff members that don't seem to know how things work at this school than I care for, especially the principal and counselor. The teachers want your children to turn in the work but there is no clear way for parents to assist to make sure this is getting done. These are still children. As I was told by the prinicipal, teachers are not encouraged or required to post HW, CW, projects, etc. on-line. How do they expect parent participation. All parents can't take off work to be at the school. Teachers should learn to utilize the tools given to them to advocate parent participation (i.e. computers and e-mails). Come on now, if teachers and other public school staff do not want to foster a circle of success for students, please find another career.",

I would have to say some of the best teachers are the AP teachers, but not all are great. There are teachers who hardly teach at all, and it's all up to you to learn, but it all depends on how driven the students are. The school is extremely diverse and offers a pretty good quantity of extra curriculars. The students at Fairfax are generally open minded. The budget cuts the school has suffered haven't allowed it to improve a whole lot, but the campus has become significantly nicer. The school allows for educational and social expansion.",

Every LAUSD school has the same issues with limited services, bad food, and a typical 36:1 student-teacher ratio. The majority of the kids are bused in, but I feel we get the cream of the crop. The school has a rich history of servicing kids who want to be here. Many of the students care about graduation and do well overall. As mentioned earlier I came from schools where students came in with an impoverish mindset. I don't feel that to be the case here. The campus is very diverse and representative of the real world. My child has been sheltered attending a certified Montessori school where she is not tested as much as LAUSD schools. Eventually, she will need to experience the \"general population\" and I believe Fairfax High School would be a nice transition.",

The teachers want your children to turn in the work but there is no clear way for parents to assist to make sure this is getting done. These are still children. As I was told by the prinicipal, teachers are not encouraged or required to post HW, CW, projects, etc. on-line. How do they expect parent participation. All parents can't take off work to be at the school. Teachers should learn to utilize the tools given to them to advocate parent participation (i.e. computers and e-mails). Come on now, if teachers and other public school staff do not want to foster a circle of success for students, please find another career.",

Now the school has taken a turn for the worse with staff and parents being very displeased! She seems to make up her own rules, is unfair when it comes to discipline and pretty much does not have a clue on how to run a school! Schools are supposed to be all about the kids but in her case it's almost like she has her own personal agenda to benefit her and a certain few that buddy up to her! I can honestly say I am no longer happy with this school and if she continues to be principal my kids will no longer attend!",

On top of failing the students by not providing a safe campus (my child has been beaten up, and even threatened with bodily harm) she is cold and unwelcoming! She will not take the time to meet with parents about the crumbled PTO, and about the fact that this school has dismantled of all the arts.. (I.E. There is no art to grow on, music, choir, or drama)! Do not send your child here! Especially if they are gifted! The only plus side to this school is some amazing teachers.. Some! And I feel bad that they are forced into a corner with this woman as their leader! Where is the old principal?! This school needs a real one!",

Isn't this website partial and safe for all parents and teachers to express their point of view? What happened here? Just wondering...LAUSD receives a bomb threat and they cancel classes for that day. I received a phone call from Dodson notifying me first thing in the morning. From seventh street...nada! How much does it take to make and send a robocall to all the parents, even when we would have to hear the principal talking to us like if we were little kids? I heard from a friend that classes were cancelled but lots of parents drove to school only to find out there. What was the principal doing or thinking? What if our kids were in real danger? I guess it is the same as when there was a sewer leak at school and she didn't even bothered to notify us while the kids kept playing and walking all over it and smelling that stench. I guess the fact of getting a teacher that is not prepared really to be a principal shows in every aspect of the school, even when seeing how low scores had gone down since she took over...can we get Lisa Saldivar back? For her the kids were her #1 priority at all times!",

Thanks to the helpful staff and teachers i was able to become responsible and independent for myself and studies, which I'm eternally thankful for since it made my college life more easy. The teachers also provide great tutoring for any subject and have a great sense of humor with the students. I'm a proud 2013 graduate from this great high school and a successful college student. I just highly advise to please over look the SAT's and have your son/daughter speak with staff and helpful teachers about it in S.A.H.S. as soon as possible. If no interest is shown, the S.A.T's won't be provided for him/her if it's to late to register for the test. I know this from my past experience.",

SAHS is also accredited by the Western Association of School and Colleges. The school recieved an unheard 6-year accreditation by WASC. This speaks volumes about the school. Their academic program is student centered and the atmosphere is simply the best you can find in any school. I highly recommend this school for your children. By the way, SAHS is the only school that has made the API & AYP in LAUSD Local District 6.",

Dumbing down students with excellent potential totally unfair to the kids!!!! I have personally seen kids making out and tutors say nothing, disgusting in my opinion, a mother always wants the best for her child and I refuse to let anyone suppress their intelligence.Good luck when you think of enrolling here!!!!!",

Now the school has taken a turn for the worse with staff and parents being very displeased! She seems to make up her own rules, is unfair when it comes to discipline and pretty much does not have a clue on how to run a school! Schools are supposed to be all about the kids but in her case it's almost like she has her own personal agenda to benefit her and a certain few that buddy up to her! I can honestly say I am no longer happy with this school and if she continues to be principal my kids will no longer attend!",

On top of failing the students by not providing a safe campus (my child has been beaten up, and even threatened with bodily harm) she is cold and unwelcoming! She will not take the time to meet with parents about the crumbled PTO, and about the fact that this school has dismantled of all the arts.. (I.E. There is no art to grow on, music, choir, or drama)! Do not send your child here! Especially if they are gifted! The only plus side to this school is some amazing teachers.. Some! And I feel bad that they are forced into a corner with this woman as their leader! Where is the old principal?! This school needs a real one!",

Wonder what's happened to them? They have all been run outa school by our principals inability to be a leader. The only thing that is holding this school together is our AMAZING teachers. Someone mentioned bringing back our last principal, Mrs Saldivar? I wish!!! Our little school with a big heart is turning out to be a BIG mess. And who is to blame? Our principal. When you don't support those who have always supported you, you are going to have problems. Respect is earned.",

Isn't this website partial and safe for all parents and teachers to express their point of view? What happened here? Just wondering...LAUSD receives a bomb threat and they cancel classes for that day. I received a phone call from Dodson notifying me first thing in the morning. From seventh street...nada! How much does it take to make and send a robocall to all the parents, even when we would have to hear the principal talking to us like if we were little kids? I heard from a friend that classes were cancelled but lots of parents drove to school only to find out there. What was the principal doing or thinking? What if our kids were in real danger? I guess it is the same as when there was a sewer leak at school and she didn't even bothered to notify us while the kids kept playing and walking all over it and smelling that stench. I guess the fact of getting a teacher that is not prepared really to be a principal shows in every aspect of the school, even when seeing how low scores had gone down since she took over...can we get Lisa Saldivar back? For her the kids were her #1 priority at all times!",

Every LAUSD school has the same issues with limited services, bad food, and a typical 36:1 student-teacher ratio. The majority of the kids are bused in, but I feel we get the cream of the crop. The school has a rich history of servicing kids who want to be here. Many of the students care about graduation and do well overall. As mentioned earlier I came from schools where students came in with an impoverish mindset. I don't feel that to be the case here. The campus is very diverse and representative of the real world. My child has been sheltered attending a certified Montessori school where she is not tested as much as LAUSD schools. Eventually, she will need to experience the \"general population\" and I believe Fairfax High School would be a nice transition.",

As I was told by the prinicipal, teachers are not encouraged or required to post HW, CW, projects, etc. on-line. How do they expect parent participation. All parents can't take off work to be at the school. Teachers should learn to utilize the tools given to them to advocate parent participation (i.e. computers and e-mails).
